# Guidelines will live **here**

Check if your IDE supports autocorrections regarding the conventions listed below.

## Branch naming scheme

We structure our branch names hierarchically with a forward slash `/` as the delimiter. e.g. `IdentityManagementAL/Backend/SomeNewFeature`.

When doing a fix, we add a `Fix` at the start of the last segment. e.g. `.../FixAPIEndpoints`.

Capitalization should be "CapitalCase" only. No underscores!

## Commit message scheme

We only use the [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard 

Quick summary:
```txt
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Coding conventions

We will use the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

## Communication convention

We will use the signal Group to dicuss upcoming meetings. 
We will have a meeting every week. 
Luis Meyer will be responsible for scheduling.
